# US Honey Production Case Study

## Description

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for the US Honey Production Case Study. The goal of this study is to explore and analyze the trends and patterns in the average honey price and production in the US over the years. The analysis addresses several key questions regarding state-wise production, average prices, contributions to honey production, and changes in honey prices over time.

## Problem Statement

The dataset provided contains information on US honey consumption, including the average price of honey over the years. The aim is to explore and analyze this data to identify trends and patterns in the average honey price and gain insights into its fluctuation over time.

### Key Questions Addressed:

1. Find the state-wise production and state-wise average price for the top 5 and bottom 5 states, and visualize all four categories in a single figure.
2. Identify states that rarely contributed to honey production over the last 27 years.
3. Determine the top 5 honey-producing states in the US.
4. Analyze the change in the mean average price of honey from 1995 to 2021.
5. Identify the year when honey production in the whole US was the highest.
6. Determine which state had the highest contribution to honey production in the year 2000.
7. Identify states with the highest number of colonies in the year 2000.

## Dataset

- **Filename**: US_honey_dataset.csv
- **Columns**:
  - `Unnamed`: Index column.
  - `state`: State name in the US.
  - `colonies_number`: Number of bee colonies in the state.
  - `yield_per_colony`: Total count of bees inside a colony.
  - `production`: Production of honey.
  - `stocks`: Total stock of honey in the state.
  - `average_price`: Average price of honey per year in different states.
  - `value_of_production`: Value of honey production per year.
  - `year`: Year of production.

## Files in the Repository

## Analysis and Visualizations

The Jupyter notebook (`Case_Study_US_Honey.ipynb`) contains the following analyses and visualizations:

1. **State-wise Production and Average Price**:
   - Top 5 states in production.
   - Bottom 5 states in production.
   - Top 5 states in average price.
   - Bottom 5 states in average price.
   - Combined visualization of all four categories.

2. **Rare Contributors to Honey Production**:
   - Identification of states with minimal contributions over 27 years.

3. **Top 5 Honey Producing States**:
   - Analysis of the top 5 honey-producing states.

4. **Change in Mean Average Price**:
   - Comparison of the mean average price of honey from 1995 to 2021.

5. **Year with Highest Honey Production**:
   - Identification of the year with the highest honey production in the US.

6. **State Contribution in 2000**:
   - Analysis of state contributions to honey production in the year 2000.

7. **States with Highest Number of Colonies in 2000**:
   - Identification of states with the highest number of bee colonies in 2000.

## Results

The results of the analysis, including visualizations, can be found in the Jupyter notebook. The key findings provide insights into the trends and patterns in US honey production and prices over the years.
